        If you do not know what champion you should play in the upcoming battle, I will help you.
        It is my duty to bring the right champions to the rift.
        And it is the summoners, like you hopefully, that I send into battle.
        One might say, I select the champions randomly or compare me to a simple "rAnDoM LoL cHaMpIoN gEnErAtOr".
        Pah! My strategy goes far beyond random selection,
        even if you cannot see it yet.<br />

        So tell me, are you a summoner? What's your name?
